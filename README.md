# Identify Arvato's Customer Segments 
## <i>A Capstone Project for Udacity's Data-Science Nano-Degree</i>
### 1. Motivation
In this project, we have carried out an unsupervised machine learning approach to handle a real-life 
data-science task posed by Arvato's mail-order sales company, which concerns finding the most suitable general 
German population segments to target for their future marketing. We dealt with mainly two datasets, one for the general population,
while the other is for Arvato's customer base. Our goal was to cluster the two datasets in a way that identifies segments 
in the general population that are more suitable for marketing. This can be achieved by looking into similarities/differences in 
the distributions of each dataset's clusters that are obtained using the same clustering approach.
